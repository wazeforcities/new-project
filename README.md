# README

This is the public repository for Waze for Cities Data, a data sharing partnership program by Waze. More information about Waze for Cities and the application process can be found at waze.com/wazeforcities. 

This site enables Waze for Cities partners to share & collaborate on scripts for use with the data sets shared by Waze. 

<b>What kind of scripts?</b>
Any script compatable with our data! SQL, Python, R, or something else - we'd love to share your work with other partners!
